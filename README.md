# Interview Homework Assignment
A few questions and front-end coding projects were assigned during the interview process. I decided to combine all parts into one, semi-cohesive page. Since this was not part of the assigned requirements I did not focus on accessibility so it is currently lacking.

# The Assigned Requirements
1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can be a personal or school project. 
1. Tell me a about a book, blog, article or GitHub repo you read or liked recently, and why you like it and why you should recommend I do the same. 
1. If you were to describe to a 7-year old what Availity does, what would you say? 
1. *Coding exercise:* You are tasked to write a checker that validates the parentheses of a LISP code.  Write a program (in Java or JavaScript) which takes in a string as an input and returns true if all the parentheses in the string are properly closed and nested.
1. *Coding exercise:*   For frontend engineer: Healthcare providers request to be part of the Availity system.  Using React framework, create a registration user interface so healthcare providers can electronically join Availity.  The following data points should be collected:
  * First and Last Name
  * NPI number
  * Business Address
  * Telephone Number
  * Email address


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More
